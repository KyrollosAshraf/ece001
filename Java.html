<h2>advantages of Java Programming language</h2>

<h3>1 Simple

<h3>
2. Object-oriented
</h3>
It permits you to form standard programs and reusable code.

   <h3> 3. Platform-Independent

</h3> 
Java code runs on any machine that doesn?t need any special software to be installed, but the JVM needs to be present on the machine.



<h2>Disadvantages of Java

1. Performance
</h3>
Java is memory-consuming and significantly slower than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.


<h3>2. Look and Feel


</h3>
The default look of GUI applications written in Java using the Swing toolkit is very different from native applications.
