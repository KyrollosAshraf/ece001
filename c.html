<h1>C language</h1>
<p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972.
<br>
    It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
    <br>
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language.

<h2>Advantages of C Programming Language</h2> 
<h3>
1. Building block for many other programming languages </h3>

C is considered to be the most fundamental language that needs to be studied if you are beginning with any programming language. Many programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, etc are built with the base of the C language.
<h3> 2. Powerful and efficient language</h3>

C is a robust language as it contains many data types and operators to give you a vast platform to perform all kinds of operations.
<h3> 3. Portable language</h3>

C is very flexible, or we can say machine independent that helps you to run your 
code on any machine without making any change or just a few changes in the code.
<h3>4. Built-in functions</h3>
There are only 32 keywords in ANSI C, having many built-in functions. 
These functions are helpful when building a program in C.

<h2>Disadvantages of C Programming language</h2>


<h3>
1.  Concept of OOPs
 </h3>

C is a very vast language, but it does not support the concept of OOPs (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Data Hiding). C simply follows the procedural programming approach.<h3> 2. Run-time checking
</h3>
In the C programming language, the errors or the bugs aren?t detected after each line of code. Instead, the compiler shows all the errors after writing the program. It makes the checking of code very complex in large programs.


<h3> 3. Concept of namespace
   </h3>

C is very flexible, or we can say machine independent that helps you to run your 
Code on any machine without making any change or just a few changes in the code.
<h3>4. Low level of abstraction
</h3>
C is a small and core machine language that has minimum data hiding and exclusive visibility that affects the security of this language.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Here, we end our tutorial on ?Advantages and Disadvantages of C Programming?. We hope you found this tutorial beneficial in developing a simple understanding of the pros and cons of C.  You might have understood how powerful C is in its process of implementation and execution and at the same time how it lags behind other languages in certain aspects.
